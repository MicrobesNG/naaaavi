Naming avoiding ambiguity automatically assigning valid identifiers


## What is it?

`Naaaavi` (pronounced `nah-vee` as if someone hadn't injected a load of ambiguous confusing `a` characters) is a simple Python tool for generating identifiers.
It generates human-friendly identifiers using `diceware` or `base32`, but also screens candidate identifiers for look-alike pairs or long repeats that may cause errors during transcribing.
